 history 
on 23 november 2008 the first public acknowledgement of an unmanned mission to mars was announced by then-isro chairman g madhavan nair the mom mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the indian institute of space science and technology after the launch of lunar satellite chandrayaan-1 in 2008 prime minister manmohan singh approved the project on 3 august 2012 after the indian space research organisation completed ₹125 crore us17 million of required studies for the orbiter the total project cost may be up to ₹454 crore us63 million the satellite costs ₹153 crore us21 million and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other isro projectsthe space agency had planned the launch on 28 october 2013 but was postponed to 5 november following the delay in isros spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the pacific ocean launch opportunities for a fuel-saving hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018assembly of the pslv-xl launch vehicle designated c25 started on 5 august 2013 the mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at indian space research organisation satellite centre bengaluru and the finished spacecraft was shipped to sriharikota on 2 october 2013 for integration to the pslv-xl launch vehicle the satellites development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months despite the us federal government shutdown nasa reaffirmed on 5 october 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission during a meeting on 30 september 2014 nasa and isro officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore mars one of the working groups objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the maven orbiter and mom as well as other current and future mars missions


 cost 
the total cost of the mission was approximately ₹450 crore us73 million making it the least-expensive mars mission to date the low cost of the mission was ascribed by k radhakrishnan the chairman of isro to various factors including a modular approach few ground tests and long 18–20 hour working days for scientists bbcs jonathan amos mentioned lower worker costs home-grown technologies simpler design and a significantly less complicated payload than nasas maven


 mission objectives 

the primary objective of the mission is to develop the technologies required for designing planning management and operations of an interplanetary mission the secondary objective is to explore mars surface features morphology mineralogy and martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments

 payload 

the 15 kg 33 lb scientific payload consists of five instruments
atmospheric studies
lyman-alpha photometer lap – a photometer that measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from lyman-alpha emissions in the upper atmosphere measuring the deuteriumhydrogen ratio will allow an estimation of the amount of water loss to outer space the nominal plan to operate lap is between the ranges of approximately 3,000 km 1,900 mi before and after mars periapsis minimum observation duration for achieving laps science goals is 60 minutes per orbit during normal range of operation the objectives of this instrument are as followsestimation of dh ratio
estimation of escape flux of h2 corona
generation of hydrogen and deuterium coronal profiles
methane sensor for mars msm – was meant to measure methane in the atmosphere of mars if any and map its sources with an accuracy of parts-per-billion ppb after entering mars orbit it was determined that the instrument although in good working condition had a design flaw and it was not capable of detecting methane the instrument was repurposed as an albedo mapper
particle environment studies
mars exospheric neutral composition analyser menca – is a quadrupole mass analyser capable of analysing the neutral composition of particles in the range of 1–300 amu atomic mass unit with unit mass resolution the heritage of this payload is from chandras altitudinal composition explorer chace payload aboard the moon impact probe mip in chandrayaan-1 mission menca is planned to perform five observations per orbit with one hour per observation
surface imaging studies
thermal infrared imaging spectrometer tis – tis measures the thermal emission and can be operated during both day and night it would map surface composition and mineralogy of mars and also monitor atmospheric co2 and turbidity required for the correction of msm data temperature and emissivity are the two basic physical parameters estimated from thermal emission measurement many minerals and soil types have characteristic spectra in tir region tis can map surface composition and mineralogy of mars
mars colour camera mcc – this tricolour camera gives images and information about the surface features and composition of martian surface it is useful to monitor the dynamic events and weather of mars like dust stormsatmospheric turbidity mcc will also be used for probing the two satellites of mars phobos and deimos mcc would provide context information for other science payloads mcc images are to be acquired whenever msm and tis data is acquired seven apoareion imaging of the entire disc and multiple periareion images of 540 km × 540 km 340 mi × 340 mi are planned in every orbit


 telemetry and command 

the isro telemetry tracking and command network performed navigation and tracking operations for the launch with ground stations at sriharikota port blair brunei and biak in indonesia and after the spacecrafts apogee became more than 100,000 km an 18 m 59 ft and a 32 m 105 ft diameter antenna of the indian deep space network were utilised the 18 m 59 ft dish antenna was used for communication with the craft until april 2014 after which the larger 32 m 105 ft antenna was used nasas deep space network is providing position data through its three stations located in canberra madrid and goldstone on the us west coast during the non-visible period of isros network the south african national space agencys sansa hartebeesthoek hbk ground station is also providing satellite tracking telemetry and command services


 communications 
communications are handled by two 230-watt twtas and two coherent transponders the antenna array consists of a low-gain antenna a medium-gain antenna and a high-gain antenna the high-gain antenna system is based on a single 2.2-metre 7 ft 3 in reflector illuminated by a feed at s-band it is used to transmit and receive the telemetry tracking commanding and data to and from the indian deep space network


 mission profile 


 launch 

as originally conceived isro was to launch mom on its geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle gslv but as the gslv failed twice in 2010 and isro was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the mom project for at least three years isro opted to switch to the less-powerful polar satellite launch vehicle pslv since the pslv was not powerful enough to place mom on a direct-to-mars trajectory the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns to take advantage of the oberth effect to place itself on a trans-mars trajectoryon 19 october 2013 isro chairman k radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching fiji the launch was rescheduled for 5 november 2013 isros pslv-xl placed the satellite into earth orbit at 0950 utc on 5 november 2013 with a perigee of 264.1 km 164.1 mi an apogee of 23,903.6 km 14,853.0 mi and inclination of 19.20 degrees with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed during the first three orbit raising operations isro progressively tested the spacecraft systemsthe orbiters dry mass is 500 kg 1,100 lb and it carried 852 kg 1,878 lb of fuel and oxidiser at launch its main engine which is a derivative of the system used on indias communications satellites uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from earth it was also used to slow down the probe for mars orbit insertion and subsequently for orbit corrections
models used for mom


 orbit raising manoeuvres 

several orbit raising operations were conducted from the spacecraft control centre scc at the isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac at peenya bengaluru on 6 7 8 10 12 and 16 november by using the spacecrafts on-board propulsion system and a series of perigee burns the first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results while the fourth was only partially successful however a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre a total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in earth orbit with a seventh burn conducted on 30 november to insert mom into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to mars
the first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 november 2013 at 1947 utc when the spacecrafts 440-newton 99 lbf liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds with this engine firing the spacecrafts apogee was raised to 28,825 km 17,911 mi with a perigee of 252 km 157 mithe second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 november 2013 at 2048 utc with a burn time of 570.6 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40,186 km 24,970 mithe third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 november 2013 at 2040 utc with a burn time of 707 seconds resulting in an apogee of 71,636 km 44,513 mithe fourth orbit raising manoeuvre starting at 2036 utc on 10 november 2013 imparted an incremental velocity of 35 ms 110 fts to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135 ms 440 fts as a result of underburn by the motor because of this the apogee was boosted to 78,276 km 48,638 mi instead of the planned 100,000 km 62,000 mi when testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system the flow to the liquid engine stopped with consequent reduction in incremental velocity during the fourth orbit burn the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested when both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes the flow to the liquid engine stopped operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations however they could be operated independently of each other in sequenceas a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 november 2013 that increased the apogee to 118,642 km 73,721 mi a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre the apogee was raised to 192,874 km 119,846 mi on 15 november 2013 1957 utc in the final orbit raising manoeuvre


 trans-mars injection 

on 30 november 2013 at 1919 utc a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of mom away from earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward mars the probe travelled a distance of 780,000,000 kilometres 480,000,000 mi to reach mars


 trajectory correction maneuvers 
four trajectory corrections were originally planned but only three were carried out the first trajectory correction manoeuvre tcm was carried out on 11 december 2013 at 0100 utc by firing the 22-newton 4.9 lbf thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds after this event mom was following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in april 2014 was not required the second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 june 2014 at 1100 utc by firing the spacecrafts 22 newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds the third planned trajectory correction manoeuvre was postponed due to the orbiters trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory the third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 3.9 seconds long on 22 september 2014


 mars orbit insertion 

the plan was for an insertion into mars orbit on 24 september 2014 approximately 2 days after the arrival of nasas maven orbiter the 440-newton liquid apogee motor was test fired on 22 september at 0900 utc for 3.968 seconds about 41 hours before actual orbit insertion
after these events the spacecraft performed a reverse manoeuvre to reorient from its deceleration burn and entered martian orbit


 status 

the orbit insertion put mom in a highly elliptical orbit around mars as planned with a period of 72 hours 51 minutes 51 seconds a periapsis of 421.7 km 262.0 mi and apoapsis of 76,993.6 km 47,841.6 mi at the end of the orbit insertion mom was left with 40 kg 88 lb of fuel on board more than the 20 kg 44 lb necessary for a six-month missionon 28 september 2014 mom controllers published the spacecrafts first global view of mars the image was captured by the mars colour camera mccon 7 october 2014 the isro altered moms orbit so as to move it behind mars for comet siding springs flyby of the planet on 19 october 2014 the spacecraft consumed 1.9 kg 4 lb of fuel for the manoeuvre as a result moms apoapsis was reduced to 72,000 km 45,000 mi after the comet passed by mars isro reported that mom remained healthyon 4 march 2015 the isro reported that the msm instrument was functioning normally and are studying mars albedo the reflectivity of the planets surface the mars colour camera was also returning new images of the martian surfaceon 24 march 2015 mom completed its initial six-month mission in orbit around mars isro extended the mission by an additional six months the spacecraft has 37 kg 82 lb of propellant remaining and all five of its scientific instruments are working properly the orbiter can reportedly continue orbiting mars for several years with its remaining propellanta 17-day communications blackout occurred from 6 to 22 june 2015 while mars orbit took it behind the sun from earths viewon 24 september 2015 isro released its mars atlas a 120-page scientific atlas containing images and data from the mars orbiter missions first year in orbitin march 2016 the first science results of the mission were published in geophysical research letters presenting measurements obtained by the spacecrafts menca instrument of the martian exosphereon 17 january 2017 moms orbit was altered to avoid the impending eclipse season with a burn of eight 22 n thrusters for 431 seconds resulting in a velocity difference of 97.5 metres per second 351 kmh using 20 kilograms 44 lb of propellant leaving 13 kg remaining eclipses were be avoided until september 2017 the battery is able to handle eclipses of up to 100 minuteson 19 may 2017 mom reached 1,000 days 973 sols in orbit around mars in that time the spacecraft completed 388 orbits of the planet and relayed more than 715 images back to earth isro officials stated that it remains in good healthon 24 september 2018 mom completed 4 years in its orbit around mars although the designed mission life was only six months over these years moms mars colour camera has captured over 980 images that were released to the public the probe is still in good health and continues to work nominally
